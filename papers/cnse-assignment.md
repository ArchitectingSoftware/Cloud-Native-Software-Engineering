## Assignment: Cloud Native Software Engineering Landscape 

The "Cloud Native Software Engineering" paper is a paper that I wrote to frame some of the open challenges that I see where software engineering needs to evolve to better support creating modern Cloud Native architectures. (_Note that I normally don't use my own publications in my classes_).

#### Assignment

Start by reading the paper, you can get it here: [Cloud Native Software Engineering](./cnse-mitchell.pdf).  [Note that GitHub sometimes has trouble rendering PDFs directly, if you run into this you can hit the download icon - it looks like this <img src="./GH_Download_Icon.png" height="25"> in the menu bar- to get this paper].  After reading the paper, provide a short summary addressing the following:

1. Pretend that you are a senior engineer working at a company that just decided that they were going to move a significant amount of their development to the cloud.   A colleague discovered this paper online and emailed it to you because he/she thought it is something that you would be interested in reading (after all you are doing a masters degree in a computer science program).  After reading this paper please address:

> I found the following \<FILL-IN-THE-BLANK\> contribution from the paper the most interesting / impactful.  Please elaborate from the perspective of how you think what you choose would be instrumental to your companies success. _Note it could be something that you new learned from the paper, or something that you already knew about but you think is critical for success based on your previous education and/or work experience as a software engineer_.


#### Optional - But I would appreciate it

As I mentioned above, I normally don't use my open papers in my classes.  I tend to think that students would be reluctant to provide candid insight given the content was authored by the course instructor.  That said, I am very interested in candid feedback about this paper.  Anything you liked in particular, anything you disagree with, or could be better described? _Note answering this question is completely optional_

#### Submission

You can either submit your solution directly in Blackboard in one of the supported formats (PDF, Word, etc.), or even better, write it up using markdown and submit it from the GitHub/GitLab repository you are using for the programming deliverables of this course.  If you choose this route, create an appropriately named directory in your repo, and submit a link to where your writeup is located in Blackboard.  

1. Brevity and Conciseness are important skills to develop with writing, something that I continue to work on myself.  Your writeup should be targeted to approximately one page of text, but should not be any longer than two pages. 

2. Due dates will be tracked and managed on our class Blackboard site, and not here on GitHub.
