## Assignment: Above The Clouds 

The "Above The Clouds" paper by Berkeley is considered one of the seminal papers in Cloud Computing.  It has been cited almost 10,000 times, and its important to be familiar with seminal works in cloud computing.  This paper outlines a framework for what Cloud Computing _"could and should be"_ in 2009, roughly only 3 years after the recognized birth of the public cloud in 2006.

#### Assignment

Start by reading the paper, you can get it here: [Above The Clouds: A Berkeley View of Cloud Computing](./AboveTheClouds.pdf).  After reading the paper, provide a short summary addressing the following:

1. One of the primary objectives of this paper is to motivate how Cloud Computing can redefine _"Computing as a Utility"_.  From a utility, think about things like power and water - you turn the light switch on, and the lights come on without you having to know anything about the complex aspects needed to deliver the power to your house.  Same for water, you turn on the sink and safe, clean water flows out of the faucet (at least I hope it does).  Using power and water as a conceptual model for a utility, how well do you think this paper motivates **RAW COMPUTE ASPECTS** of Cloud Computing as a utility?  By _"raw compute aspects"_ I mean pure computing resources such as processing (CPU/GPU, etc.), storage, and network. 

2. Now address the same question as above from a **SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE**. By a _"software engineering perspective"_ I mean that you are a software engineer responsible for design, delivery and operation of a product or service that will be deployed and made available to your customers from the cloud. From this perspective can you outline **one example** where the analogy of a pure utility (power and water) still applies, and **one example** where it doesn't?  Hints: Take a careful look at the _"Obstacles and Opportunities"_ section of the paper, or you can do some other online research, for example looking into the AWS _"Shared Responsibility Model"_.  You are not limited to these sources when answering this question - feel free to research this question and be creative.  Make sure you reference any resource that you used to help answer this question, web links are fine, no need for formal references.

#### Additional Information and Requirements

1. To get full credit you must answer the questions above, and not just provide a broad paper summary.

2. You may use large language models (Chat GPT, Bard, etc) "as a search engine" to help with understanding or supporting your research to answer these questions.  You may not use them to author your solution.  Note there are AIs that are very good at quantifying the probability that text was authored by an AI versus a human.  Please avoid the temptation. 

3. You can either submit your solution directly in Blackboard in one of the supported formats (PDF, Word, etc.), or even better, write it up using markdown and submit it from the GitHub/GitLab repository you are using for the programming deliverables of this course.  If you choose this route, create an appropriately named directory in your repo, and submit a link to where your writeup is located in Blackboard.  

4. Brevity and Conciseness are important skills to develop with writing, something that I continue to work on myself.  Your writeup should be targeted to approximately one page of text, but should not be any longer than two pages. 

5. Due dates will be tracked and managed on our class Blackboard site, and not here on GitHub.
